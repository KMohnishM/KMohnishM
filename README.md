🧠 **About Me**  
I'm Mohnish Mythreya – an engineer who believes technology isn’t just about code, but about creating systems that adapt, scale, and help people grow.

I’m currently in my 3rd year at VIT Chennai. From designing AI-driven learning systems to building real-time dashboards, I chase ideas that blend **intelligence with infrastructure**.

What excites me?  
→ Systems that **think**, **learn**, and **serve with purpose**.  
→ Tools that **make lives easier** — whether it's for a student stuck on a bug or a team managing a cloud pipeline.
